# Hostel-Management-System
The Hostel Management System is designed to manage the day-to-day administrative operations of a college hostel. The system offers student registration, hostel booking, complaint handling, and feedback collection. Admins (wardens) can monitor all activities, review logs, and maintain hostel records, ensuring smooth and efficient operations.
